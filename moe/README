This is the programming contest environment used by the Czech Programming Olympiad
and some other competitions.

You will find a brief documentation in the doc/ directory inside the package (start
with doc/index.html) or on-line at http://www.ucw.cz/moe/.

The whole package can be distributed and used under the terms of the GNU General
Public License version 2.

If you have any suggestions, bug reports or improvements you would like to share
with others, please send them to mj@ucw.cz.

** How to build Moe **

First of all, edit default.cfg to choose which components should be built.

Then run "./configure" and "make". This will place all compiled binaries in "run/".

By default, documentation is built, which requires AsciiDoc to be present.
You can skip documentation by "./configure -CONFIG_DOC".
