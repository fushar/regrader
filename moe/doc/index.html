<h1>The Moe Contest Environment</h1>

<p>The Moe Contest Environment (formerly Moe) is a system for conducting
programming competitions similar in spirit to the
<a href="http://www.ioinformatics.org/">International Olympiad in Informatics</a> &ndash;
contestants solve programming tasks, submit the source code of their solutions,
which is then automatically tested on a set of test inputs.

<p>Moe is built in a modular way, making it easy to adapt it to the specifics
of a particular contest, to other types of tasks, or other programming languages.

<p>A brief description of the system and of the ideas behind it can be found in the following series
of papers published in <a href="http://www.mii.lt/olympiads_in_informatics/">Olympiads in Informatics</a>:

</ul>

<b>News (2012-09-24):</b> A new sandbox module (<code>isolate</code>) is available.
It has very low overhead (it uses Linux kernel containers) and it is able to cope with
multi-threaded programs. For more details, see the "New Contest Sandbox" paper above
or the <a href="isolate.1.html">isolate's man page</a>.

<h2>Modules</h2>

<table class=modules>
<tr><th>module
    <th>description
    <th>status
<tr><td>sandbox
    <td>Runs the contestant's solution in a controlled and secure environment,
	limiting its execution time, memory consumption and system calls.
	We have a stable implementation (<code>box</code>) based on ptrace
	and a new one (<code>isolate</code>) based on Linux kernel containers.
    <td class=statedone>works
<tr><td>judges
    <td>A set of utilities for comparing the solution's output with the correct
	answer at a given level of strictness.
    <td class=statedone>works
<tr><td>evaluator<br>(a.k.a. grader)
    <td>This module controls the whole process of grading the solution. It runs
	the compilers, the sandbox and the judges as described in configuration
	files.
    <td class=statedone>works
<tr><td>evaluator v2
    <td>We have decided to rewrite the evaluator from scratch in Python for greater
	flexibility. It will however need some more time to finish.
    <td class=statewip>in progress
<tr><td>queue manager
    <td>Distributes grading between a cluster of computers, each of them running
	the evaluator.
    <td class=statepart>works, but needs revision
<tr><td>submitter
    <td>Handles submitting of solutions by contestants and passing them to the
	evaluation system. Contains a server daemon and a front-end for contestants.
	(If your contest uses a web-based contestant interface, you probably do not
	need this, although it can serve as a clean interface between your web services
	and the evaluator.)
    <td class=statepart>works, but needs revision

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>Moe is still under heavy development, so the best way to obtain the latest
version is directly from our <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a> repository at git://git.ucw.cz/moe.git.
The master branch of the repository is kept in a stable state, new development
is done on other branches and then merged to the master. You can also <a href="http://www.ucw.cz/gitweb/?p=moe.git;a=summary">browse
the repository online</a>.

<p>We occasionally publish snapshot tarballs in our <a href="ftp://ftp.ucw.cz/pub/mj/eval/">FTP archive</a>.

<h2>Contests</h2>

<p>Moe (or some of its modules) are used at the following contests:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://mo.mff.cuni.cz/p/index.html.en">Czech Olympiad in programming</a> since 2002
<li><a href="http://mo.mff.cuni.cz/cpspc/">CPSPC</a> (Czech-Polish-Slovak Preparation Camp) on some years
<li><a href="http://www.fi.muni.cz/ceoi/">CEOI 2007</a> (Central-European Olympiad in Informatics)
<li><a href="http://www.ioinformatics.org/">IOI<a> since 2009 (used the sandbox module)
<li><a href="http://codex2.ms.mff.cuni.cz/project/">CodEx</a> (a web-based system, originally
	designed for evaluation of students' homeworks, but also used for several programming
	contests)
</ul>

<h2>Languages</h2>

<p>Moe is known to work with these programming languages:

<ul>
<li>Pascal (<a href="http://www.freepascal.org">Free Pascal Compiler</a>)
<li>C and C++ (<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a>)
<li>C# (<a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> with some hacks)
<li>Haskell (<a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a>)
</ul>

<p>Adding a new language should be easy, as long as the language behaves in a sane
way (e.g., if it does not need to use a zillion threads for a trivial program
as Java does).

<h2>Portability</h2>

<p>Moe is developed and tested on Linux, but all modules except the sandbox should
happily work on any UNIX-like system providing a reasonable set of GNU
utilities (especially bash) and Perl. This probably includes MinGW or Cygwin
on Windows, but we have not tested that.

<p>The sandbox heavily depends on the target OS. The current version works
only on Linux with kernel version 2.6 or newer and only on the i386 and amd64
architectures. Porting to other architectures should require only minor changes,
porting to other systems is likely to be hard.

<p>The <code>isolate</code> sandbox does not depend on CPU architecture,
but it requires a recent Linux kernel in a configuration which might be different
from your distribution's default.

<h2>Authors</h2>

<p>Moe has been written by the following people:

<ul>

<li>Tom&aacute;&scaron; Gaven&#269;iak (the queue manager module and parts of the new evaluator)
<li>Bernard Blackham (parts of <code>isolate</code>)
</ul>

<p>We are also thankful to Jan K&aacute;ra and Milan Straka for their help and for
many fine ideas.
