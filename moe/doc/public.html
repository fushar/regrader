<h1>Utilities of contestants</h1>

<p>Moe also offers several utilities for use by the contestants. They are by default
installed to the <code>public</code> directory, where you also should install a subset
of the <code>problems</code> hierarchy containing the config files and public test
cases (e.g., the example input/output from the problem description sheet).

<ul>
<li><code>compile</code> &ndash; compile a solution with the same settings as used
by the evaluator.
<li><code>check</code> &ndash; compile a solution and check it on the public test cases.
<li><code>submit</code> &ndash; submit a solution for evaluation, after <code>check</code>-ing it.
Each successfully submitted solution replaces the previous submitted solution for the same task.
</ul>

<h2>How does it work</h2>

<p>Compilation and checking use the same evaluation mechanism as used later for the
real evaluation. However, it runs with the privileges of the contestant and is limited
only to the publicly available test cases. The evaluation log is put to a file called
<code>log</code> in the current directory, all other files are put to a <code>.box</code>
subdirectory in the contestant's home.

<p>Submit stores all submitted tasks to a <code>.submit</code> directory in the
contestant's home. It's probably wise to warn the contestants that they shouldn't
delete this directory :-)
