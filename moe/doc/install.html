<h1>The Installation of Moe</h1>

<p>Moe can be installed in two possible ways:

<h2>Minimal Installation</h2>

<p>Just invoke <code>make</code> and edit the top-level config file to suit
your needs, leaving <code>TEST_USER</code> commented out.

<p>In this setup, everything lives in the source tree you have started with
and you don't need any special privileges for neither installation or running
of the evaluator.

<p><em>Beware: The evaluated programs are <b>NOT</b> fully separated
from the evaluation environment and they could interfere with it. Use it only for
playing with the package, not for any real competition.</em>

<h2>Normal Installation</h2>

<p>The recommended way is to let the evaluator use two user accounts. One (let's
call the user <code>moe</code>) runs the evaluator and keeps all secret
files like the test data, another one (<code>mo-test</code>) runs the tested
programs. There can be multiple test users if you want to run several evaluators
in parallel. However, in practice the evaluation is so fast that this is seldom
needed.

<p>How to set up this installation:

<ul>
<li>Run <code>make</code> to compile all programs.
<li>Edit <code>config</code> to suit your needs, in particular set <code>MO_ROOT</code>,
<code>EVAL_USER</code>, <code>EVAL_GROUP</code>, <code>TEST_USER</code> and <code>TEST_USERS</code>.
<li>Create <code>$MO_ROOT</code> (here we will assume that it's set to <code>/aux/mo</code>
<li>Create the evaluation users:
<pre>
	moe:x:65000:65000:MO Evaluator:/aux/mo/eval/moe:/bin/bash
	mo-test1:x:65001:65000:MO Tester 1:/aux/mo/eval/mo-test1:/bin/bash
	mo-test2:x:65002:65000:MO Tester 2:/aux/mo/eval/mo-test2:/bin/bash
</pre>
<li>And the evaluation group:
<pre>
	moe:x:65000:
</pre>
<li>Run <code>bin/mo-install</code> as root to create the directory hierarchy under <code>$MO_ROOT</code>
install all parts of the evaluator there and set the correct access rights.
<li>Log in as <code>moe</code> and do everything else from there.
<li>Later, you can reinstall parts of the hierarchy, without affecting the rest, by running:
   <ul>
   <li><code>mo-create-public</code> to update the public data available to contestants
	according to the contents of the <code>public</code> directory
   <li><code>mo-create-testusers</code> to update the home directory of the <code>mo-test</code> users.
   </ul>

</ul>

<h2>Contestants' homes</h2>

<p>Moe can either take care of the home directories of contestants or use
an existing infrastructure. In the former case, you need to do the following:

<ul>
<li>Set <code>CT_UID_MIN</code> and <code>CT_UID_MAX</code> in the top-level config file.
(The evaluator users described above should be outside this range!).
<li>Create the contestant users inside the UID range you defined; choose names as you wish:
<pre>
	mo00:x:65100:65100:MO Contestant 00:/aux/mo/users/mo00/mo00:/bin/bash
	...
	mo99:x:65199:65199:MO Contestant 99:/aux/mo/users/mo99/mo99:/bin/bash
</pre>
<li>Create a group for each of these users (preferably with the same ID's):
<pre>
	mo00:x:65100:
	...
	mo99:x:65199:
</pre>
<li>(You can use the <code>bin/mo-create-logins</code> script to automate this
process, including printing of leaflets with passwords, but you will probably need
to customize the script.)
<li>Run <code>bin/mo-create-contestants</code> as root to create the home directories.
(The permissions are set up so that the contestants cannot see each other's directory
even if they want. However you still need to make sure that there is no directory
all of them can write to, like the system-wide <code>/tmp</code>. In our contest,
the users work on their own machines and only the home directories are shared across
the network, so this problem doesn't arise.)
<li>If multiple contestants work on the same machine remotely, you need to set quotas
and other limits for them. On some systems, you cannot use <code>limits.conf</code>
for that, because <code>sshd</code> applies the limits as root, so you either
limit root or the limits don't work at all. In such cases, modify <code>/etc/profile</code>:
<pre>
	if [ $UID -ge 65100 -a $UID -le 65199 ] ; then
		ulimit -Sc 8192		# core file size
		ulimit -SHu 32		# processes
		ulimit -SHn 256		# max open files
		ulimit -SHv 262144	# max virtual memory
	fi
</pre>
</ul>
