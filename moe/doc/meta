Moe meta-files
##############

Grammar:
~~~~~~~~

<file> = <attribute>*

<attribute> = (<single> | <nested> | <comment>)

<single> = <indent> <name> ":" <value> "\n"

<nested> = <open> <attribute>* <close>
<open> = <indent> <name> "(" "\n"
<close> = <indent> ")" "\n"

<indent> = (<sp>|<tab>)*
<name> = (A-Z | a-z | 0-9 | "-" | "_")+
<value> = (<any-printable-UTF8-char> | 0x09)*

<comment> = ("\n" | <indent> "#" <value> "\n")

-- there can be multiple attributes with the same name
-- spaces can be present only where explicitly allowed by the grammer
