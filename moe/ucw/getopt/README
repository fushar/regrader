This directory contains getopt routines from the GNU libc 2.5.
We need this as a fallback for our reset_getopt(), because there is
no standardized interface for such instruction.

They are distributed under the GNU LGPL.

All files are exact copies of the original distribution with very
few exceptions commented with `// SHERLOCK' prefix.
I only provided my own getopt-sh.c, getopt-sh.h and Makefile.
