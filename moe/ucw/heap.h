/***
 * [[intro]]
 * Introduction
 * ------------
 *
 * Binary heap is a simple data structure, which for example supports efficient insertions, deletions
 * and access to the minimal inserted item. We define several macros for such operations.
 * Note that because of simplicity of heaps, we have decided to define direct macros instead
 * of a <<generic:,macro generator>> as for several other data structures in the Libucw.
 *
 * A heap is represented by a number of elements and by an array of values. Beware that we
 * index this array from one, not from zero as do the standard C arrays.
 *
 * Most macros use these parameters:
 *
 * - @type - the type of elements
 * - @num - a variable (signed or unsigned integer) with the number of elements
 * - @heap - a C array of type @type; the heap is stored in `heap[1] .. heap[num]`; `heap[0]` is unused
 * - @less - a callback to compare two element values; `less(x, y)` shall return a non-zero value iff @x is lower than @y
 * - @swap - a callback to swap two array elements; `swap(heap, i, j, t)` must swap `heap[i]` with `heap[j]` with possible help of temporary variable @t (type @type).
 *
 * A valid heap must follow these rules:
 *
 * - `num >= 0`
 * - `heap[i] >= heap[i / 2]` for each `i` in `[2, num]`
 *
 * The first element `heap[1]` is always lower or equal to all other elements.
