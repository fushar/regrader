Linked lists
============

Ucwlib defines two basic linked list structures: single-linked lists and circular linked lists.
Both of them support insertion of any number of nodes, removal of nodes and various searches.
Single-linked lists are a bit simplier (they especially requires smaller nodes)
but some operations need assymptoticaly more time.

Linked lists can be used very simply. We define a structure as list's handle and
a common header in all inserted nodes. All routines then accept and return pointers
to this handle and node headers.
