Introduction
------------

Binomial heap is a data structure that supports for example efficient merge of two heaps, insertions, deletions or access to the minimum element.
All these operations are logarithimc in the worst case. If the merge is not significat, it is usually better to use simplier <<heap:,binary heaps>>.

They are defined in `ucw/binheap.h` as <<generic:,generics generated by preprocessor>>, some common definitions are also in `ucw/binheap-node.h`.
