Compression
===========

The library contains a compression routine, called LiZaRd.  It is
modified Lempel-Ziv 77 method with slightly worse compression ratio,
but with faster compression and decompression (compression is few times
faster than zlib, decompression is slightly slower than memcpy()).

The data format and inspiration for code comes from the LZO project
(which couldn't be used due to licence problems). They might be
compatible, but no-one tested that.
